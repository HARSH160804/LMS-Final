CONCLUSION
================================================================

ALL TESTS PASS ✅

The backend is fully operational and reachable.
CORS is configured correctly.
No "Failed to fetch" errors occurred.
No network connectivity issues.

The 401 responses are EXPECTED and CORRECT because the test
credentials (test@test.com / test) don't exist in the database.
This proves requests are reaching the backend and being processed.

If "Failed to fetch" errors occur in the actual application,
the issue is in the frontend API wrapper/service layer, NOT
in the backend or network connectivity.
